ALog
======

"ALog" holds the "Logger" data logger library for the Arduino-based ALog (http://northernwidget.com/alog/) developed by Andy Wickert and Chad Sandell at Northern Widget LLC and the University of Minnesota.

While it is developed to work specifically with the ALog, it will also work with a standard Arduino that is outfitted with a SD card and a DS3231 real-time clock.

"Logger" is optimized to handle all of the basic file, system, and power management behind-the-scenes, and to reduce power consumption to minimal levels through the use of the sleep functions. It exposes sensor functions as single-line calls, and includes a template for the addition of new sensors.
