{\bfseries A\+Log} holds the {\bfseries Logger} data logger library designed for the Arduino-\/based A\+Log (\href{http://northernwidget.com/alog/}{\tt http\+://northernwidget.\+com/alog/}), but that will also work with any standard Arduino-\/\+Uno-\/based system that is outfitted with a SD card and a D\+S3231 real-\/time clock.

This library is optimized to\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item handle all of the basic file, system, and power management behind-\/the-\/scenes, including power consumption reduction to minimal levels through the use of the sleep functions
\item include and expose sensor functions as single-\/line calls, with a template for the addition of new sensors.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
