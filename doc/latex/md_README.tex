\char`\"{}\+Logger\char`\"{} is the data logger library for the Arduino-\/based A\+Log (\href{http://northernwidget.com/alog/}{\tt http\+://northernwidget.\+com/alog/}) developed by Andy Wickert and Chad Sandell at Northern Widget L\+LC and the University of Minnesota.

While it is developed to work specifically with the A\+Log, it will also work with a standard Arduino that is outfitted with a SD card and a D\+S3231 real-\/time clock.

\char`\"{}\+Logger\char`\"{} is optimized to handle all of the basic file, system, and power management behind-\/the-\/scenes, and to reduce power consumption to minimal levels through the use of the sleep functions. It exposes sensor functions as single-\/line calls, and includes a template for the addition of new sensors.
