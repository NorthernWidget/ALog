# ALog

**ALog** holds the **Logger** data logger library designed for the Arduino-based ALog (http://northernwidget.com/alog/), but that will also work with any standard Arduino-Uno-based system that is outfitted with a SD card and a DS3231 real-time clock.

This library is optimized to:
1. handle all of the basic file, system, and power management behind-the-scenes, including power consumption reduction to minimal levels through the use of the sleep functions
2. include and expose sensor functions as single-line calls, with a template for the addition of new sensors.

If you use the ALog library (and/or data logger) in a publication, please cite:
